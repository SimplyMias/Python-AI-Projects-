# AI Python Projects 🧠🐍

This repository is a collection of my personal AI projects built with Python. Each folder contains a self-contained project with code, requirements, and documentation.

## Projects

- [Rock Paper Scissors AI](./rock-paper-scissors-ai/) - A basic game with AI logic using random and rule-based strategies.
- *(More coming soon...)*

## How to Use

Each project contains its own `README.md` with setup and usage instructions. Make sure to check requirements before running.

## Goal

To document my journey in learning and building with AI—project by project.
